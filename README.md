# sentiment-tagging-tweets
Demo for showing tweets and having users tag them through a survey in Volunteer Science.

You can import this code into Volunteer Science. However, you'll need to create your own consumables list of Tweet IDs. Make sure the name of the consumables list and set are the same as in your code. But feel free to call them what you want.
